Decentralized Exchange (DEX) App README

This repository contains the code for a basic decentralized exchange (DEX) app. The DEX allows users to trade Ethereum (ETH) for a custom token on the Ethereum blockchain.

Overview
The DEX consists of two main components:

Smart Contract (Solidity):
The smart contract, written in Solidity, defines the logic for buying and selling tokens.
Users can buy tokens by sending Ether to the contract, and they receive tokens in return.
Users can sell tokens by sending tokens to the contract, and they receive Ether in return.
The contract maintains a mapping of user addresses to token balances.
Frontend Interface (HTML, JavaScript, Web3.js):
The frontend interface provides a user-friendly way to interact with the smart contract.
Users can connect their Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the interface.
Users can buy tokens by specifying the amount of Ether they want to exchange.
Users can sell tokens by specifying the amount of tokens they want to exchange.
Getting Started
To run the DEX app locally, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Deploy the smart contract to an Ethereum testnet or local blockchain.
Update the frontend interface (index.html) with the deployed contract address and ABI.
Open index.html in a web browser.
Dependencies
Solidity: Solidity is a programming language used for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
Web3.js: Web3.js is a JavaScript library that allows interaction with Ethereum nodes.
MetaMask: MetaMask is a browser extension that enables users to interact with Ethereum-based applications.
Contributing
Contributions to the DEX app are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
